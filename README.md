## Assumption ##
* Assume the game is gaining popularity for the analysis and the entire population of the users is much greater than the population of users who made the purchase
* Assume the in game purchase population is the whole users and not sample of users

## Goal ##
With given data, analyze the in game spending to recommend growth for the company by increasing the profit of in-game purchase

Onced cleaned analysis will be done by filtering out through groups. 

We will take a look at gender, age groups, users and the specific items. Looking at amount of money spent on average on each of these group will help find a target group that the company can have to increase profit. Among those categories sub category analysis of how much each person spent is calculated to have more in depth analysis. 

## Conclusion ##

Followings are reccommendation for the game company:

* Total player count for the in-game purchase is low when assuming it is a popular game. So first recommendation is to increase the interest of players of making a purchase. An event can be created to peak players' interest in making purchases. Also the follwoing analysis should be taken in consideration as general direction. The low sample size does not dipict the best analysis of what the current market looks and it may skew the outcome.

* This game is largely popular for teenagers from age 15-24 compromising of 63% of the users. Assuming majority of the players made purchase, this is the age group the game should aim to attract. Researches to find the interest of the gamers in the age group should be completed to increase the players.

* Among the top 5 items that are sold, 3 items are sold at high 4 dollars range. It shows that users are more than willing to pay high 4 dollars, which gives a good point of pricing for items. If the customers are willing to pay 4.61 dollars for an item, company should not be posting items that are 2 dollars. Specialized and unique items could be much higher in cost.

* Looking at the age group analysis, people in their 30's are buying high priced items. It is shown through lower number of counts of users making purchases yet high in purchase costs per person. This age group could be a good target to increase the profit, for they are more willing to spend money.
